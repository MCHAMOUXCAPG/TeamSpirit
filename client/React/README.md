### **Develop with React**:

There are several ways to start a React project [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html).

In this project, [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) is used. It allows us create a project with a TypeScript setup.

### **Build and run** the app:

Follow:

- clone or download code, navigate to project's root folder
- install modules with `npm install`
- Run the App with `npm start`
- A browser window will be opened.
- Enjoy your app


### **Testing** the app:

Follow:

- Use this database [database.db](https://github.com/MCHAMOUXCAPG/TeamSpirit/blob/RN-testing/client/React/cypress/assets/database.db)
- open cypress with `npx cypress open` for the first time
- open cypress with `npm run cypress:open` if not the first time
- A cypress window will be opened.

- To run these tests, the application must be loaded. Ensure having access to http://localhost:4200
- Run all tests clicking in "Running all specs"
- A Chrome browser window will be opened with the tests.
- Wait until all are finished
